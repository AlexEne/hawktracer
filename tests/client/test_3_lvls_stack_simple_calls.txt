# This file contains information about the expected call tree that CallGraph should build for
# a specific sequence of events.
#
#
# Each block is being proceded by the the number of lines it contains.
#
#
# First block describes the expected node data. Each node has
# ID - unique id
# LABEL - event's label
# CNT_CALLS - number of times this node is called if it's root
# LAST_START_TS - the start time of the last call
# LAST_STOP_TS - the end time of the last call
# TOTAL_DUR - sum of durations of all calls 
# TOTAL_CHILDREN_DUR - total duration of its children
#
#
# Second block describes the edges between these nodes. They need to form a tree
# ID - unique id of the node being described
# PARENT_ID - unique id of the parent of the node
# CNT_CHILDREN - number of children 
# (CHILD_ID, CNT_CALLS) - sequence of pairs describing the children; they need to be in 
#                         the order you expect CallGraph to build (increasing order by
#                         their first start time)
#       CHILD_ID - unique id of the child
#       CNT_CALLS - total number of times it is being called by parent
#
#
# Third block describes the sequence of events that you are passing to CallGraph.make()
# LABEL - event's label
# START_TS - start event time
# DURATION - event's duration
